## Criteria

| Nr | Criterion           | Explanation                                                                                                                                     |
|---:|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1 | Units and Positions |The character starts at x = 0, y = 0. It is 1 unit high and wide. the pivot point of the character is lowered by 0.5 to be able to stand  properly.                                                             |
|  2 | Hierarchy           | The nodes all hang onto a graph called Game, which also holds the ComponentCamera. <br><b>Game:</b><ul><li>character</li><li>floor</li><li>collectables</li><li>shelves</li><li>cashRegister</li><li>backgrounds</li></ul>                                                               |
|  3 | Editor              | I used the Editor to create the Level. The collectables are created in the code, because the order can be changed.                                                           |
|  4 | Scriptcomponents    | I used CustomComponentScript for the different Opponents. If I wanted to make more opponents of 1 type i could to that easier with those.                                                          |
|  5 | Extend              | I used a class for the collectables to make it easier to spawn the collectables in the level.                       |
|  6 | Sound               | I used background music on the level, aswell as "pop" sounds on the collectables, when they are collected. There is also a sound when the player completes the game successfully.                                            |
|  7 | VUI                 |The VUI consists of a grocery list, that tells the player which groceries they still need to collect. It updates based on the groceries the player collects.                                       |
|  8 | Event-System        |I created a custum event for the "checkout" at the end of the game. When the player brings the groceries to the cash register this event triggers.|
|  9 | External Data       | The config.json sets the hearts and the points of the player.      Create a configuration file your application loads and adjusts to the content. Explain your choice of parameters.                 |
|  A | Light               | There is an Ambient Light and all the Textures have a ShaderLitTexture.        If light is required, explain your choice of lights in your graphs (1)                                                               |
|  B | Physics             | With the RigidBody the collision of the opponent and the player is detected. The  pink Opponent is moved with Physics.       Add rigidbody components and work with collisions (1) and/or forces and torques (1) and/or joints (1)                                 |
|  C | Net                 | ---                                                                                               |
|  D | State Machines      | The black Opponent has 2 states. 1 is Idle and if the Player is near it, it goes into its Attack state.          Create autonomous entities using the StateMachine (1) and/or ComponentStateMachine (1) defined in FudgeAid                         |
|  E | Animation           | I used Spritesheets for the Player and the opponents.       Animate using the animation system of FudgeCore (1) and/or Sprites (1) as defined in FudgeAid
